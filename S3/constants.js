     * Splitter is used to build the object name for the overview of a
     * multipart upload and to build the object names for each part of a
     * multipart upload.  These objects with large names are then stored in
     * metadata in a "shadow bucket" to a real bucket.  The shadow bucket
     * contains all ongoing multipart uploads.  We include in the object
     * name some of the info we might need to pull about an open multipart
     * upload or about an individual part with each piece of info separated
     * by the splitter.  We can then extract each piece of info by splitting
     * the object name string with this splitter.
     * For instance, assuming a splitter of '...!*!',
     * the name of the upload overview would be:
     *   overview...!*!objectKey...!*!uploadId
     * For instance, the name of a part would be:
     *   uploadId...!*!partNumber
     *
     * The sequence of characters used in the splitter should not occur
     * elsewhere in the pieces of info to avoid splitting where not
     * intended.
     *
     * Splitter is also used in adding bucketnames to the
     * namespacerusersbucket.  The object names added to the
     * namespaceusersbucket are of the form:
     * canonicalID...!*!bucketname
