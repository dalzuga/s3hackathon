* Items for Development
- Create a kinetic-init.js file to serve as a custom init.js for the
  kinetic backend. Leave blank for now - if we need to initialize any
  values or copy code from the original init.js, we can add to it
  later. Maybe leave a console log so we can see when it is being run.

- Add "kinetic_backend" to scripts in package.json
  * First try
    "kinetic_backend": "S3BACKEND=testvalue node testscript.js"
    where testscript is a script that does a console.log and prints
    process.env.S3BACKEND

  * If above works, use
    "kinetic_backend": "S3BACKEND=kinetic node kinetic-init.js && index.js
