* Points to Investigate

** Kinetic drives
   Rona and Daniel have been discussing whether S3 supports Kinetic drives
   out of the box or if this is functionality that you have to add.

   - According to Scality's S3 repo and Giorgio's demo video, Docker is used
     for "persistent file storage."
