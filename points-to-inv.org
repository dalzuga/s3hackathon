* Points to Investigate

** Kinetic drives
   Rona and Daniel have been discussing whether S3 supports storage on
   Kinetic drives out of the box or if this is functionality that you
   have to add.

   - According to Giorgio's demo video (https://vimeo.com/169727743),
     Docker is used for "persistent file storage." This implies that
     by default, the data stores "localMetadata" and "localData" (see
     https://github.com/scality/s3) are Docker volumes.

   - According to press releases by Scality and Seagate, the Ring has
     built-in support for Kinetic drives. Presumably Scality's Ring
     runs ON "standard x86 drives"
     (http://www.seagate.com/solutions/partners/scality-seagate-kinetic/)
     and communicates WITH Kinetic drives to store objects. The press
     releases do not mention whether Scality's S3 server is also able
     to use Kinetic drives for storage.
